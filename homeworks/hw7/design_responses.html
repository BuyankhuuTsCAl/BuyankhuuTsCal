						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked how they explained each concepts in alot of details and images. Using the ideas of grouping mentioned in the articles. The way they explained the concepts felt very much like the concept of grouping as they would briefly introduct the concept and then explain how it's used. I really got to deepen my understanding of spacing and how it implies a similarity or disconnectiveness of objects placed either far or close to each other. I learned new ways to show connectivity including similar transformation or movements.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  I really liked the formating of this article. I think the formatting helped explain the concepts very well and break the complex ideas in very neat and clear ways. The most important aspect of this article was how organizated the ideas were for me.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "have you ever looked at the sky noticing an unusually shaped cloud, resembling a familiar animal or an object?" ""</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 8. I think the way they explained everything was really nice but some facts were quite basical and obvious. Would have been better if they included more complex concepts of designs that were intuitive. </p>
