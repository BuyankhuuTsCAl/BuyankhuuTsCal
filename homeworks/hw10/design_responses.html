							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> It was a very interesting topic to learn about. It was very different compared to our other articles in the style they presented and the topic. It was very interesting to learn about attention and the different types and what impacts it. In the future,  I will like to use what was mentioned within the article in my designs. An import example is the idea of selective attention and how people usually choose between important and less important stimuli.  </p>
