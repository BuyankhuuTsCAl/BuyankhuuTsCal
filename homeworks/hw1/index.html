            One thing that I learned from the article is the small details that go unnoticed when users are using an app. I think one of the small details mentioned within the article is the possibility of showing potential searches on the search bar.

            One of my favoritie aspects of the article is how they break down the app's that people are use to using such as spotify and show the different features one by one. I think it was a cool way of using what they were talking about how design is purposeful in controlling the user's attention
