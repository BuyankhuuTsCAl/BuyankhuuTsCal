						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It was interesting learning that "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms". Additionally, that the size of an object should play into the consideration of the speed of the object. In terms of listing items, it would be ideal that each of the items would be listed instantly and that motion blur  should be avoided. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One of the components that I like about the article is the fact that they provide an example to each paragraph that they give us. They also provide  details of what to avoid and what to make sure to include which is helpful to engage on what should be ideal for the users. FInally the range of the topics within animation does help prove its claim  within its name.   </p>
