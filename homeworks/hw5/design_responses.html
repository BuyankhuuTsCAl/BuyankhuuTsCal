                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Despite the lack of words, I think that the  article gave numerous examples of design in terms of photos, colors and animation. The examples that they gaves were all unique in their own ways ranging from topics of sports to maps. I think these examples are perfect on how to purposefully make smart design choices to optimize UI. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think in the previous question, I kinda answered aspects of this question. One of the most important thing I really liked is the diverse examples of design. I really liked how the applications were animated and made to look like they were individual apps on the website. However, I would have liked to have more descriptions to the design choices and why they made those choices. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Personally, I really liked the very first example and will use it's design as a inspiration for my future projects. I think that the design choices were very clear and purposeful considering that they promoted their mission as a app related to sports or goal based mission via the usage of the very first picture/gif. Because they had only  two buttons and the gif, the focus was primarly on the gif and then transitions as the user presses on one of the buttons which is a very impressive design choice. Finally, I really liked the color combinations that they decided to use as it highlighted a peaceful emotion using white and grey.    </p>

                            <p> 5. I think they needed to have descriptions with each gif.  </p>
